                    <p>What About Messenger App Technology?</p>
                    <p>Messenger apps are now commonplace, with many brands employing the technology to connect their

                    <p>The technology behind messaging apps has been in widespread use since the early 90s, but it
                        really
                        rose in popularity in the early 2000s with the advent of messaging apps like AOL Messenger. By
                        2013,
                        the number of messages being sent via these apps surpassed that of SMS messages.</p>

                    <p>Now, messaging apps attract billions of users, and theyâ€™re in use all over the world. WhatsApp
